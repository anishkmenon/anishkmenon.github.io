              Hi, I'm Anish. I design learning journeys that help people grow into who they already are—not who they're told to be.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              My learning story began quiet, in classrooms where questions were often silenced. Everything shifted after a professor invited me to ask differently. That spark led me on a 15,000 km motorcycle journey across India, wilderness training, and into experiential learning—where I found home.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              Over 16+ years across APAC & Europe, I've built learning experiences that honour presence over performance. I've co-designed leadership programs with Adyen, facilitated journeys at Dubai Islamic Bank, and led outdoor adventures through Off-Road Adventures & Learning.
            </p>

              Growth doesn't happen because someone tells you how to lead. Growth happens when someone holds space for you to find how you want to lead.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              I bring systems coaching (ORSC), Nonviolent Communication (NVC), experiential design, and deep facilitation experience to make learning real, contextual, and human.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              Wherever we meet—campfire, boardroom, or virtual—my goal is to help people reconnect with their voice and awareness.
            </p>

              Thanks for being here. Let's create something that matters.
